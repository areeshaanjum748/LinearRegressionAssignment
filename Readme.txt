### Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)**: For preprocessing, train-test splitting, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- **statsmodels**: For statistical analysis, particularly in evaluating multicollinearity.

### Dataset Description
This section provides an overview of the dataset used in the analysis, covering various attributes and their roles in the analysis.

### Data Preprocessing
- **Scaling**: `MinMaxScaler` is used to scale the features.
- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing subsets.
- **Multicollinearity Management**: Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is calculated to manage multicollinearity among features.

### Feature Selection
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**: Utilized to identify the most impactful features for the model.

### Model Training and Evaluation
- **Model**: Linear Regression is used to predict the target variable.
- **Metrics**: Evaluation is performed using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² Score to assess model performance.
